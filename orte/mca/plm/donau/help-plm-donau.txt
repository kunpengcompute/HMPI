[multiple-prefixes]
The DONAU process starter for Open MPI does not support multiple
different --prefix options to mpirun. You can specify at most one
unique value for the --prefix option (in any of the application
contexts); it will be applied to all the appliation contexts of your
parallel job.

Put simply, you must have Open MPI installed in the same location on
all of your DONAU nodes.

Multiple different --prefix options were specified to mpirun. This is
a fatal error for the DONAU process starter in Open MPI.

The first two prefix values supplied were:
    %s
and %s
#
[no-hosts-in-list]
The DONAU process starter for Open MPI didn't find any hosts in
the map for this application. This can be caused by a lack of
an allocation, or by an error in the Open MPI code. Please check
to ensure you have a DONAU allocation. If you do, then please pass
the error to the Open MPI user's mailing list for assistance.
